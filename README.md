# SudoOCR

Just take a screenshot of a 9x9 sudoku table and let pytesseract and z3 solve it for you.
Built using python Flask and tailwind css. Make sure you have a .env file with TESSERACT_PATH set to your own tesseract installation (got mine from [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)). After that just run app.py to run the server locally.
